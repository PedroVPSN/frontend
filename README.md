## Final MERN project

My final project at Code Nation bootcamp was an e-commerce website that I developed using MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and Node).

### About

This is an online games store for playstation games

### The main features of the website

Registration and log in/out pages (data is stored in MongoDB)
A shop page where you can filter the products by category and price
A product search bar
User and admin routes with dedicated dashboard
CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) capabilities for products and categories

### What I have learned so far while working on this project

I have learned how to connect a database to a server, how to post and get information from the database and how to use React Hooks.

I am very proud of what I have achieved in such a short period of time, and I will keep learning and challenging myself every day.
